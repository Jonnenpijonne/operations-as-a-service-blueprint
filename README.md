# OaaS â€” Operations as a Service Blueprint

**Public-safe operations model for small regulated IT, platform and DevSecOps environments.**

This repository demonstrates how operational responsibilities, runbooks, service boundaries, escalation paths, change governance, recovery thinking and audit evidence can be packaged into a reusable **Operations as a Service** model.

It is not a production managed service, customer delivery package, incident record or commercial contract. It is a portfolio-safe reference model for operational maturity.

---

## Purpose

Many technical environments fail operationally not because the technology is impossible, but because ownership, escalation, recovery, documentation and evidence are unclear.

OaaS focuses on removing this friction:

```text
Who owns the service?
What is included?
What is out of scope?
How are incidents handled?
How are changes approved?
How is recovery tested?
What evidence exists?
How can another person take over?
```

The goal is to make operations understandable, transferable, reviewable and evidence-driven.

## Provenance

This is a clean authored extraction of the operations and governance material originally developed during portfolio work in `Jonnenpijonne/OaaS`.

The third-party platform source, Java/Maven implementation and upstream build workflows are intentionally not included here.

The purpose of this repository is the reusable operations model itself: ownership, service boundaries, escalation, controlled change, recovery, evidence and handover.
---

## Business value

OaaS reduces operational friction by making service ownership, incident handling, change governance and evidence responsibilities explicit.

This helps reduce:

- undocumented operational knowledge
- key-person dependency
- unclear ownership
- weak handovers
- uncontrolled changes
- audit preparation friction
- recovery uncertainty
- confusion between public examples and private customer evidence

---

## Portfolio positioning

This repository fits a DevSecOps / regulated IT / platform operations portfolio as the operational service layer:

```text
Gatehouse = change governance
RBAC-Lite = access-control governance
ESP32 lab = edge-device governance
Local-First WordPress DevSecOps Kit = safe local development baseline
OaaS = operational ownership, runbooks, service reviews, escalation and evidence
```

---

## What this is not

This repository is not:

- a production managed service
- a customer delivery record
- a real incident report
- a real SLA contract
- a monitoring platform
- a certification claim
- a replacement for organization-specific policies
- a public storage location for customer or production evidence

---

## One-sentence summary

**OaaS shows how a technical environment can be operated in a documented, transferable and evidence-driven way without keeping everything inside one person's head.**
